# Empower (by W 0 N D 3 R and kitea)

Empower is a moderately dark grayscale pack with accents of glowing purple and dark red. The icons/assets were kept mostly vanilla with some customizations towards the theme, like lightning bolts. The worn equipment tab features pixel art of full bis mage gear to fit the theme. This pack is ideal for a clean recolor that won't be distracting during pvm.

This pack was designed in collaboration with kitea (creator of GhibliScape). Kitea led the artistic direction, and elements created using Krita and ibisPaint X by me.
