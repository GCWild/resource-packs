## Description

It's a table. Many, many hand drawn re-imaginations of most of the common textures you see. Send me feedback and/or ideas on Discord (name: tekt) if you want. 

Resizeable mode works but primarily made for fixed mode.

The chat selection buttons are a rat.

Note the transparent bits on the table, wow!

## Credits
Using textures from the game, all editing done with paint.net. Took me about 3 weeks of active editing, drawing and thinking up ideas. This was a lot more work than I thought lol

I am tekt on Discord and elsewhere on the internet
